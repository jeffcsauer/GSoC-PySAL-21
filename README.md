Hi I'm Noah - this repository contains work contributing towards my project for Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

Alongside this project, I am writing a blog noting my progress and keeping track of what I am learning. You can find that on my website: https://noahbouchier.github.io/

Go well!
