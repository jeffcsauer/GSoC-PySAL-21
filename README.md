Hi I'm Noah - this repository contains work contributing towards my project for Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

Folders in this repository are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Example Data - Leicester, UK** - data used in the example implementation of this methology. Focusing on the city of Leicester from the 2011 UK Census. Including **Unmerged Data from the ONS**, containing the boundary (geometery) data of Leicester from the census and demographic data on the ethnic identity of Leicester's residents - both at Output Areas (OA) scale. The *leicester_ethnicity* GeoPackage (.gpkg) is a merging of both of these pieces of data - and is overviewed in the [read_shapefile](https://github.com/noahbouchier/GSoC-PySAL-21/blob/master/Explanatory%20and%20Interactive%20Workbooks/read_shapefile.ipynb) notebook.

- **Explanatory and Interactive Workbooks** - workbooks outlining the work contributing towards the GSoC project. Hopefully written at a level that any beginner Python user may be able to interpret them. Please feel free to make any comments on improvements through the [Review of the `read_shapefile` and `kl_divergence` notebooks](https://github.com/noahbouchier/GSoC-PySAL-21/issues/1) issue.

- **Schedule** (out-of-date) - a PDF outlining the schedule of the project. From beginning of coding to end of GSoC period.

Alongside this project, I am writing a blog noting my progress and keeping track of what I am learning. You can find that on my website: https://noahbouchier.github.io/

Go well!
